<!-- PORTFOLIO -->
## üìÑ Portfolio

### [Project 1: Hate Speech Detection](https://github.com/JensBender/hate-speech-detection)
+ Motivation: Develop a hate speech detector for social media comments. 
+ Data: Utilized the [ETHOS Hate Speech Detection Dataset](https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/Ethos-Hate-Speech-Dataset).
+ Models: The fine-tuned BERT model demonstrated superior performance (78.0% accuracy) compared to the SimpleRNN (66.3%) and LSTM (70.7%) models.
+ Deployment: The fine-tuned BERT model was prepared for production by integrating it into a web application and an API endpoint.

## [Project 2: ChatGPT Cover Letter Generator](https://github.com/JensBender/chatgpt-cover-letter-generator)
Utilize AI to write your cover letter. 

How it works:
+ Enter the URL of the job posting you want to apply for and information about yourself. 
+ The ChatGPT cover letter generator will extract information about the employer, the job title, the requirements, the tasks, the contact person and the company address from the job posting. 
+ Then, it will match the education, work experience, skills, and motivation that you provided to the tasks and requirements of the job posting. 
+ Finally, it will add your salary expectations and possible start date and create three cover letter suggestions that you can fine-tune to apply for the job.
